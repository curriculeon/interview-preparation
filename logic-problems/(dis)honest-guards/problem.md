* You are a prisoner in a room with
    * 2 indistinguishable doors
        * One of the doors will lead you to certain freedom.
        * One of the doors will lead you to certain doom.
    * 2 indistinguishable robot-guards
        * One of the guards always tells the truth.
        * One of the guards always tells lies.
* You must enter one of these doors, but you can only ask a single question to a single guard.
* **What question must you ask to ensure that you are lead to certain freedom**?
