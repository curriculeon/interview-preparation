# Curriculeon Maven Template
* **Objective** - The purpose of this repository is to create a standard template to clone from when creating new projects.

## How to use
* To use this project as template, _clone_ the project into you `~/dev` directory.
* Upon cloning, open the project in a text editor (VSCode, IntelliJ, SublimeText, Atom, etc.)
* Ensure that the `artifactId` of the project is changed from `maven-template-project` to a more appropriate project name.
* Click view the [`README-Sample.md`](./README-Sample.md) to view _how_ a `README` should be structured for a project.
